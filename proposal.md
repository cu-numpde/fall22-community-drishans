# Community Software Analysis Proposal

## Software: *Elmer*

*Elmer is an open source multiphysics software suite that uses the finite element method for the solution of PDEs. It contains a mesh conversion tool (ElmerGrid), a graphical interface (ElmerGUI), a numerical solver (ElmerSolver), and a post-processing module (ElmerPost). It was developed in Finland by the Center for Science (CSC-IT) and its primary audience are scientists and researchers in universities, industry, and laboratories who wish to model a variety of physical phenomena. It includes physical models of fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, electromagnetics, heat transfer and acoustics.*
